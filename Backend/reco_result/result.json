The actives are titanium dioxide and zinc oxide (which are quite absorbent on their own), and the talc-based formula applies well despite feeling too dry. All six shades are recommended. The compact for this product adds $8 to your purchase. Note: This foundation does contain a small amount of fragrance, though not in any amount that should be a concern except for those with sensitive skin."

This talc-based, pressed-powder foundation has a dry but silky texture that goes on soft and even, providing seamless light to medium coverage. It could function as your only sunscreen if you apply it liberally (meaning thick), but it works best when dusted over a regular sunscreen or foundation with sunscreen. The shade range is beautifully neutral, but lacks options for dark skin. The only color to avoid is the too-peach B60 Natural Deep Beige. ",

                "Described as being more than a foundation, Chanel wants you to know they have created \u201cthe consummate skin-caring makeup.\u201d That sounds great, but the ingredient list doesn\u2019t support the boast. In terms of texture, this has a beautifully silky feel and includes a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an in-part titanium dioxide base, but that\u2019s only a start when it comes to ultimate skin-caring makeup. Where are the antioxidants and cell-communicating ingredients? How about some anti-irritants or skin-identical ingredients like ceramides or hyaluronic acid? They\u2019re not here, save for a teeny, tiny amount of plant oil and plant extracts with antioxidant ability. That doesn\u2019t add up to being worth $65. ",
                "Even though this is a long way off from being skin-caring makeup, you can count on reliable sun protection, supremely smooth application, and an attractive satin matte finish suitable for normal to slightly dry or slightly oily skin. Coverage begins at medium and can be built to nearly full camouflage, although doing so produces a heavier look that is not easily softened. ",
                "The majority of shades are neutral and ideal for fair to medium skin tones. Avoid the following shades because they are too pink, orange, or rose to look convincing: Natural Beige, Naturel, and Tawny.",
                "One more point: It goes without saying that this foundation won\u2019t firm skin in any noticeable way, though it definitely creates the illusion of smooth, even-toned skin.",
                "Note: This foundation\u2019s rating is due to its overall performance rather than its SPF rating. Due to concerns about people not applying sunscreen liberally enough to get the amount of SPF protection stated on the label, it is often recommended to look for SPFs with ratings higher than 15. If you plan to use foundation as your sole source of facial sun protection, consider using one rated SPF 20 or greater. If the foundation with sunscreen you choose is rated less than an SPF 20, we strongly advise applying it over a daytime moisturizer rated SPF 15 or greater and following it with a pressed powder rated SPF 15 or greater. That way, you\u2019re ensuring sufficient broad-spectrum protection which is essential for having and maintaining healthy, younger-looking skin at any age.",

Once this foundation sets, the finish is best described as matte with only a slight sheen, but no shimmer.",

The shades are divided into colors for Light, Medium, and Deep skin tones, with corresponding numbers for Maybelline\u2019s Fit Me! Pressed Powder shades, along with skin-tone matches for Maybelline\u2019s Fit Me! concealer, blush, and bronzers.",

Foundation tends to change color a bit once it\u2019s on your skin for a few minutes, so you want to spend plenty of time with the testers before you decide on a shade. Many Light shades veer toward orange and peach tones after setting, while Medium shades look quite yellow. There isn\u2019t any single shade to definitely avoid, but picking the best one is more of a gamble than usual. There are some very good (new) dark shades in the Women of Color collection.",

I have been using inexpensive foundations for years and did well with Revlon until they discontinued my product.  This is a beautiful replacement.  It slips on even mature skin, adds just the right amount of color and corrects for pores and small discolorations.  It has that hard-to-define quality of making you quietly glow, which is what we'd all like from our foundation, I suspect.  At the price it's impossible to lose with this one.",

I always check it to make sure there aren't terribly irritating ingredients in the formula I should avoid, but makeup is definitely more of a personal preference.   I'm absolutely in love with this foundation and agree with the other Canadian reviewer.   I live in very harsh winter conditions and have dry dehydrated skin at the best of times.  I'm 35 years old and a bit of a foundation junkie.  I cannot get over that in my entire collection my $6 (bought on sale) Maybeline Fit me foundation out performs just about every other foundation I have!  It is my #1 or #2 foundation! (Might be a close second to my Dr. Jart Premium BB Cream).  This foundation is so smoothing and doesn't highlight any dry patches or fine lines.  It's not overly dewy but it is radiant enough that my skin looks fresh and healthy.  I think the coverage is plenty for the average consumer but I definitely prefer lighter foundations with concealer where I need it.  It's a match made in heaven for me!  I also use shade 110 (and 15 fair in the concealer) with no noticeable change in colour.  I've also recently tried the Loreal Lumi foundation which is quite similar but I think I prefer the Fit Me foundation.  I did wish there was no sunscreen in this foundation as I prefer to wear my own PC mineral sunscreen underneath my foundations due to rosacea.  In any case, I haven't noticed any sensitivity with this formula.",

I had my eye on Chanel's Vitalumiere but after getting a sample of it from my local department store, decided I hated it. I have dry, dehydrated skin and winter is particularly harsh in my corner of Canada so I'm not in the market for a matte product. On a whim I bought this last week and hoped for the best with the colour match (I got the lightest shade 110). I applied it several times over the weekend and honestly couldn't believe this was from the drugstore. It softened the appearance of my 40something skin. I couldn't stop looking in the mirror. Plus the colour match is spot on. It's neither particularly hydrating nor drying. And I ALWAYS wear a standalone SPF so that wasn't a factor for me. I highly recommend this foundation. It's like my skin but better.",

I keep trying to find the perfect product and have preference for a cream to powder type compact for convenience. Tried this one after doing a Beautipedia research read and then a trip to Priceline. And yes, it's great, goes on quite mouse like, spreads easily and sets matte, and it lasts through the day. My colour is 200 Soft Beige and I've almost finished this tube. The package is opaque so you can't tell how much is left but that's no issue versus the 6 other products sitting in my drawer unused due to bad colour matching. My bad. Try this one if you need a bit more coverage, it's a keeper",

Purchased this last minute cheap foundation after reading the reviews on Beautipedia and it worked like a charm. Tried other drugstore foundations as well the days leading to the event but this one won by far.  I couldn't believe that something so cheap could work so well.  Only issue was that the event was outdoor so some sunscreen would have been great.",

And yes, it's great, goes on quite mouse like, spreads easily and sets matte, and it lasts through the day. My colour is 200 Soft Beige and I've almost finished this tube. The package is opaque so you can't tell how much is left but that's no issue versus the 6 other products sitting in my drawer unused due to bad colour matching. My bad. Try this one if you need a bit more coverage, it's a keeper",

Purchased this last minute cheap foundation after reading the reviews on Beautipedia and it worked like a charm. Tried other drugstore foundations as well the days leading to the event but this one won by far.  I couldn't believe that something so cheap could work so well.  Only issue was that the event was outdoor so some sunscreen would have been great.",
