                "This primer smooths easily across skin, setting to a very soft matte finish that's good for all skin types except very oily. The initial color of this primer looks and applies light pink, but it sheers out entirely once blended.",
                "The blurring effect this delivers works to soften the look of pores, blemishes, and other imperfections plus creates a smooth canvas for makeup. It also helps foundation last about an hour longer than usual.",
                "As for the claim of it preventing makeup from getting into skin, that's a bit silly, as makeup doesn't invade pores in quite the way that Tatcha seems to think, and all primers provide some form of barrier between your skin and makeup (your regular skin care does too, for that matter). Besides, makeup isn't meant to absorb into skin, it's formulated to stay on the surface. Otherwise, why bother applying it?",
                "That aside, our most significant issue with this primer is that it contains fragrance. It's not present in great amounts, and it dissipates quickly, but any amount of fragrance has the potential to cause skin irritation. Were it not for that one misstep, this would rank among our best primers.",
                "One more comment: This primer isn't made of \"pressed silk\" as claimed; rather, its first ingredient is cyclopentasiloxane, is a synthetic silicone that feels incredibly silky on skin. It isn't a bad ingredient but given the (unfair) bad wrap silicones tend to get, we can see why Tatcha chose such phrasing. The formula does include two forms of silk, but for certain what makes it feel so silky is the silicone, not the actual silk.",

That doesn't make this a bad primer; just one with claims that are a little too overblown!",

It works well as a makeup primer, creating a smooth canvas for foundation without making it slide around on your face. One definite positive: it's fragrance-free!",
