Inspired by a skincare/makeup hybrid thats a cult favorite in Asia, this formula combines water-attracting molecules to boost hydration, light-reflective pearls to brighten dull skin, botanical extracts and caffeine to reduce discoloration and redness, pore-refining peptides such as Argireline Peptide to minimize fine lines and fight wrinkles, and broad-spectrum UVA/UVB protection with SPF 35 and antioxidants to fend off future damage. This in-between skin perfecter for normal to oily skin also creates a smooth canvas for flawless foundation application and fights shine to give a natural-looking matte finish. Consider it your skins new best friend. ",

                "Bobbi Brown's entry into the BB cream world is a very good one!  Like most BB creams, BB Cream Broad Spectrum SPF 35 provides broad-spectrum sun protection and includes titanium dioxide for reliable UVA (think anti-aging) protection.",
                "Texture-wise, this is light, yet creamy, and wonderfully smooth. It's a pleasure to blend, feeling very much like a skincare product rather than makeup. It sets to a soft satin-like finish that looks natural while providing light to medium coverage, and is best for normal to slightly dry or slightly oily (combination) skin. It is suitable for breakout-prone skin, too.",
                "A formulary element worth noting is that Brown added antioxidants plus cell-communicating and skin-repairing ingredients to this BB cream, which makes good on the purpose of a BB cream to not only provide color and sun protection, but also treat skin to the beneficial ingredients it needs. It's fragrance-free, too, which is always preferred (fragrance can be a source of irritation).",
                "As for the shades, Brown previously offered five but have recently upped their game to include nine excellent color options, ranging from Extra Light to Deep-- all are neutral to warm (as is the trend for Bobbi Brown foundations and tinted moisturizers).  We recommend testing the shades carefully before purchasing (or ask at the counter for a sample). The Extra Light shade is great for fair skin, while Dark, Rich, and Deep work for deeper skin tones while avoiding an ashen look.",
                "Bobbi Brown's BB Cream Broad Spectrum SPF 35 earned its high rating not only due to its fragrance-free formula, beautifully smooth texture and natural coverage but also for containing both a wide range of skin-friendly ingredients and broad-spectrum SPF 35 rating.  For those with normal to slightly dry or slightly oily skin, this is a great option, and worth checking out!",

It is the base white pigment (also present in latex paint) used to generate the cream's color. In this BB cream the high SPF comes from the 3 chemical sunscreen ingredients.\n\nThat said, I still think this is a good foundation (what BB creams are). It's fairly thick but spreads and blends really well over moisturized skin. My only complaint is that it is hard to dispense the right amount every time. I guess I can't complain too much, as I have had it for more than 19 months, using it 2-5 times per week. I'm going to try something more moisturizing next, but I would buy this again.",

It is the base white pigment (also present in latex paint) used to generate the cream's color. In this BB cream the high SPF comes from the 3 chemical sunscreen ingredients.\n\nThat said, I still think this is a good foundation (what BB creams are). It's fairly thick but spreads and blends really well over moisturized skin. My only complaint is that it is hard to dispense the right amount every time. I guess I can't complain too much, as I have had it for more than 19 months, using it 2-5 times per week. I'm going to try something more moisturizing next, but I would buy this again.",

This isn't it. I don't get the love. It's goes on dry and sits on top of skin, magnifying every pore, line, and flake. Terrible, inelegant formula. And to think, Estee Lauder owns Bobbi Brown. Could the techs get together and just put Crescent White back on the market in some form, please?",

                "Laneige extols BB Cushion SPF 50+ as a revolutionary BB cream with \"cushion technology\" that comes into play as you press the included puff (or your fingertips) into the compact's sponge soaked with the liquid formula. While that may sound intriguing, this kind of compact isn't the most practical, and, more important, the formula itself is a mixed bag of good and bad. Let's investigate each of the highly touted \"5-in-1\" benefits to see why.",
                "Benefit number one: Brightens. BB Cushion does contain the hydroquinone derivative, arbutin, which may have melanin-inhibiting properties. However, in this type of compact, the arbutin won't remain stable for long, although we do applaud Laneige for the effort.",
                "On the plus side, what will help prevent future dark spots from forming is the in-part mineral sunscreen, which leads us to benefit number two: Protects. BB Cushion SPF 50+ offers broad-spectrum sun protection via a blend of mineral and non-mineral sunscreen actives, which is great from a health and anti-aging perspective!",
                "Benefit three: Cools and hydrates (via \"Optimal Mineral Water\"). We debunk the mineral water gimmick in the brand summary, but here's where things get even murkier: The formula is noticeably fragranced, which means there is the potential for skin damage and irritation (see More Info). Even though BB Cushion SPF 50+ might feel nice, what it's doing below the surface is putting skin at risk. That's enough reason to avoid it, but if you're still curious, read on.",
                "Benefit four: Prevents shine. BB Cushion has a subtle light-reflective finish that looks natural and works great for normal to dry (and even slightly oily) skin, but because it lacks oil-absorbing ingredients, it does NOT prevent shine. If you have oily skin and were drawn to this product because of that claim, forget about it.",
                "Benefit five: Provides long-lasting coverage.",
                "This can be applied semi-sheer or built up for more coverage. In either regard, BB Cushion holds up reasonably well throughout the workday, so we can give them that point.",
                "",
                "Despite some decent qualities, this BB cream comes with some potentially skin-irritating side effects that really make it more trouble than it's worth. If you're intrigued regardless, three shades are offered in the United States: Light (suitable for light, but not truly fair, skin tones), Medium (on the warm side, but workable), and Dark (orangey, proceed with caution). But really, why bother when there are BB creams that far outperform this one? Check those out in our list of best-rated Tinted Moisturizers/BB Creams here.",

                "Daily use of products that contain a high amount of fragrance, whether the fragrant ingredients are synthetic or natural, causes chronic irritation that can damage healthy collagen production, lead to or worsen dryness, and impair your skin's ability to heal. Fragrance-free is the best way to go for all skin types (Food and Chemical Toxicology, 2008; and American Journal of Clinical Dermatology, 2003).",
                "The sneaky part about irritation is that research has demonstrated that you don't always need to see it or feel it for your skin to suffer damage, and that damage may remain hidden for a long time (Skin Pharmacology and Physiology, 2008).",
                "In fact, the effect of inflammation in the skin is cumulative, and repeated exposure to irritants contributes to a weakened skin barrier, slower healing (including of red marks from breakouts), and a dull, uneven complexion (Aging, 2012; and Chemical Immunology and Allergy, 2012).",

                "Just like all the others before it, Rimmel's BB cream claims to provide multiple benefits (learn more about the buzz of BB creams  here), but it falls far short of its hype. Before we delve into the full review, it's important to note that this contains a potentially irritating amount of alcohol and fragrance, coupled with synthetic sunscreen agents that can be sensitizing when used around the eye area. Sensitive skin types, stop here!",
                "In terms of performance, the creamy liquid texture is a little thicker than most Westernized BB creams (it's closer to the versions from Korea) and, hence, requires more blending. Once set, you get a seamless finish, which also provides sheer-to-medium coverage, so it's somewhere between a tinted moisturizer and a liquid foundation.",
                "The formula meshes nicely with skin and has a moisturizing and brightening effect that's ideal for normal to dry skin. One of the nine things this is said to do is mattify, but it does not do that, so oily skin is left looking shiny.",
                "The broad-spectrum SPF 25 is a nice touch, but as mentioned above, the synthetic actives can be a problem for the eye area, especially if you have sensitive skin.",
                "The big question: Is this BB cream worth buying? Given that there are superior options without the irritation issues, it's a mixed bag: It doesn't deserve to be on your short list, but it isn't bad enough to dismiss outright.",
                "Last, don't be fooled by the swatch on the packaging; you might think it mimics the shade inside, but the shade swatches are so unflattering it leaves you hesitant to even consider it. However, the actual shades of the product are natural-looking skin colors for light to medium-deep skin tones.",

Gives a really full coverage for a BB/ tinted moisturiser, more like a light foundation, which personally I was a little disappointed about (was looking for a 'no-makeup makeup' type of product), but this could be a plus depending on what you're after. I find this really wet and greasy, definitely needs to be set with a powder unless you want to feel slimy all day. The finish is okay, but there are other products in this price range that look much smoother and more natural. Overall, given the recent abundance of excellent drugstore foundations, I wouldn't recommend this as there are much better options, but if you need something in a pinch this performs totally acceptably.",

In fact, it basically goes against the multi-purpose traits BB creams are known for: The formula lacks sun protection, doesn't provide much coverage (you'll still need foundation or at least a good concealer), and is nearly void of beneficial ingredients. In short, this isn't a one-step product and is a poor replacement for a state-of-the-art moisturizer, especially one that contains sunscreen.",
                "This dispenses a grayish-white from the tube, and then turns into a flesh-toned shade as you blend. The formula contains \"pigment-filled capsules\" that burst upon application said to provide an undetectable finish. The finish isn't undetectable in terms of how it feels, because this BB cream's finish is decidedly moist, making it best for normal to dry skin.",
                "If by \"undetectable\" The Body Shop is referring to coverage, than that claim makes more sense. This goes on quite sheer, almost translucent, so it does a poor job evening your skin tone or hiding minor flaws. It slips over skin easily so blending is pleasant, but it's simply not among the best BB creams or tinted moisturizers available.",
                "Still interested? The three shades are err toward being slightly peach, but this is less of an issue because coverage is so sheer. This contains fragrance in the form of rose-scented phenethyl alcohol.",

                "Maybelline's Dream Fresh BB 8-in-1 Beauty Balm Skin Perfector's had a minor makeover since first hitting the market, and that's a good thing. Though the changes aren't huge, they are enough to make this latest version a superior product to its predecessor.",
                "Textures can differ among BB products from Western brands (versus Asian brands where BB creams became popular), but this one from Maybelline is truly a cream, and it's easy to spread across skin and blend in. The color of each shade looks a bit too unnatural straight out of the tube, but it's actually quite sheer once you apply it which means each of the six shades offered (for fair to medium-deep skin tones) are versatile enough to work for a range of skin tones.",
                "The sheer finish is also good for another reason: It means you're more likely to apply enough of this SPF 30 product to get sufficient sun protection benefits. Liberal application is always essential when applying any sunscreen!",
                "As for aesthetics, this sets to a slightly dewy finish that makes it a good choice for normal to dry skin (those with oily skin or an oily t-zone might find this product emphasizes shine).",
                "It feels moisturizing without being too rich, and does a good job meshing with skin to cover and blur minor imperfections. It also wears well without creasing or fading. Did we also mention this is fragrance free?",
                "With regard to the changes for this formula, Maybelline increased the amount of titanium dioxide included as an active ingredient, and removed a preservative that can potentially aggravate skin when used in leave-on products. We're glad to see that the brand's revamping was an improvement!",
                "If you're looking for a relatively inexpensive BB cream that does what it says and provides sun protection, then this is certainly one to consider."

I blend it using my fingers, and it sometimes takes a moment or two for the product to warm up and fully blend in, but once it is it stays put very well. I like that it gives you a little tint of colour but ultimately lets your natural skin texture and luminescence shine through. \n\nI can see how if you have oily or combination skin, it might be a little too moisturizing, but I am a desert person incapable of producing sebum, so for me it's great. In the winter I even mix in a drop or two of almond oil to help it sink in even more (yes I know diluting SPF products is not recommended, but I layer this over a moisturizer with spf so I think I'm okay, and it stops the product from balling up on my extremely dry skin). \n\nOver all, highly recommended for people with dry skin who want a nice light bit of colour!",

                            "review_content": "Canadian readers: This product DOES have the SPF of the American version, and is the same formulation as what is available in the US. It's just a matter of how the ingredients are listed. In the American version, Titanium Dioxide is listed separately as the \"active ingredient,\" while in the Canadian version, Titanium Dioxide simply appears within the ingredient list. (I just compared the ingredient list on the Maybelline Canada website to the list here on Beautypedia.)\n\nWhy the difference? In Canada, sunscreen is regulated as a drug, while makeup is regulated as a cosmetic. This even applies to cosmetics that contain sunscreen \u2013 so if a company wants to avoid having to wade through red tape to get their product approved for sale in Canada, it means that the product can't make claims about offering sun protection, even if it contains sunscreen! To get around having their product classified as a drug (and become subject to more legislation), brands sometimes relabel their products to remove claims about SPF, UVA, UVB, sunscreen, and so on.\n\nActual review: I really like this stuff. It's a nice texture, offers very light coverage, and is easy to apply. I love that it's a physical (rather than chemical) sunscreen. You might want to set with powder if you don't want a shiny T-zone, but I don't find it gets much shinier over the course of the day. The formula is so nice that it doesn't look like I'm wearing makeup, even though it really evens out my skin tone.\n\nI took off one star because the package is so small, that it's not as good value as you might initially think. For reference, it contains about half as much product as a department store foundation.",

I like that it gives you a little tint of colour but ultimately lets your natural skin texture and luminescence shine through. \n\nI can see how if you have oily or combination skin, it might be a little too moisturizing, but I am a desert person incapable of producing sebum, so for me it's great. In the winter I even mix in a drop or two of almond oil to help it sink in even more (yes I know diluting SPF products is not recommended, but I layer this over a moisturizer with spf so I think I'm okay, and it stops the product from balling up on my extremely dry skin). \n\nOver all, highly recommended for people with dry skin who want a nice light bit of colour!",

It's just a matter of how the ingredients are listed. In the American version, Titanium Dioxide is listed separately as the \"active ingredient,\" while in the Canadian version, Titanium Dioxide simply appears within the ingredient list. (I just compared the ingredient list on the Maybelline Canada website to the list here on Beautypedia.)\n\nWhy the difference? In Canada, sunscreen is regulated as a drug, while makeup is regulated as a cosmetic. This even applies to cosmetics that contain sunscreen \u2013 so if a company wants to avoid having to wade through red tape to get their product approved for sale in Canada, it means that the product can't make claims about offering sun protection, even if it contains sunscreen! To get around having their product classified as a drug (and become subject to more legislation), brands sometimes relabel their products to remove claims about SPF, UVA, UVB, sunscreen, and so on.\n\nActual review: I really like this stuff. It's a nice texture, offers very light coverage, and is easy to apply. I love that it's a physical (rather than chemical) sunscreen. You might want to set with powder if you don't want a shiny T-zone, but I don't find it gets much shinier over the course of the day. The formula is so nice that it doesn't look like I'm wearing makeup, even though it really evens out my skin tone.\n\nI took off one star because the package is so small, that it's not as good value as you might initially think. For reference, it contains about half as much product as a department store foundation.",

I like that it gives you a little tint of colour but ultimately lets your natural skin texture and luminescence shine through. \n\nI can see how if you have oily or combination skin, it might be a little too moisturizing, but I am a desert person incapable of producing sebum, so for me it's great. In the winter I even mix in a drop or two of almond oil to help it sink in even more (yes I know diluting SPF products is not recommended, but I layer this over a moisturizer with spf so I think I'm okay, and it stops the product from balling up on my extremely dry skin). \n\nOver all, highly recommended for people with dry skin who want a nice light bit of colour!",

In the American version, Titanium Dioxide is listed separately as the \"active ingredient,\" while in the Canadian version, Titanium Dioxide simply appears within the ingredient list. (I just compared the ingredient list on the Maybelline Canada website to the list here on Beautypedia.)\n\nWhy the difference? In Canada, sunscreen is regulated as a drug, while makeup is regulated as a cosmetic. This even applies to cosmetics that contain sunscreen \u2013 so if a company wants to avoid having to wade through red tape to get their product approved for sale in Canada, it means that the product can't make claims about offering sun protection, even if it contains sunscreen! To get around having their product classified as a drug (and become subject to more legislation), brands sometimes relabel their products to remove claims about SPF, UVA, UVB, sunscreen, and so on.\n\nActual review: I really like this stuff. It's a nice texture, offers very light coverage, and is easy to apply. I love that it's a physical (rather than chemical) sunscreen. You might want to set with powder if you don't want a shiny T-zone, but I don't find it gets much shinier over the course of the day. The formula is so nice that it doesn't look like I'm wearing makeup, even though it really evens out my skin tone.\n\nI took off one star because the package is so small, that it's not as good value as you might initially think. For reference, it contains about half as much product as a department store foundation.",
