Not only is the finish dry, but the powder is also absorptive, which means more drying throughout the day and an exaggeration of any amount of dry skin. The lone shade can be best described as a luminous alabaster, and will work only on the very fairest skin tones. Like many dry-textured powders, this one crumbles off the brush, making it a mess to apply."

When dispensed (even when you\u2019re being careful), it shoots out in a bubbly mound, which quickly begins to dissolve into a puddle of creamy liquid foundation that feels wet and runny as you apply.",
                "As you might imagine, it\u2019s difficult to get even application with a foundation whose consistency is bubbly, and indeed the biggest problem with this foundation is its tendency to streak and apply unevenly. It does provide light to medium coverage, but its gimmicky delivery system, difficult-to-use texture, and unnaturally shiny finish are major, and ridiculous,drawbacks.",
                "If the texture and application aren\u2019t enough to dissuade you, this foundation is also loaded with flecks of shimmer that tend to sink into lines and exaggerate wrinkles. All told, this foundation has no redeeming qualities. Check out our Best Foundations list for far superior options!",
