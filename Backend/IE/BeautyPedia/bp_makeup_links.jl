If dramatically full, defined brows is what you want, this delivers, and it holds its own as powder eyeliner, too, with only slight fading throughout the day.", "The drawback is in how the concept (deeply pigmented loose powder) was executed. Bombshell Pow-Der Brow + Liner is housed in an inkwell-style component. Unscrewing the top reveals a pen-like applicator whose tip is a small, flexible spatula. The powder inside the base of the container adheres to the applicator, which is how you transfer it to brows and your lash line.", "Because this is loose powder, it can be messy, even if you're careful to knock off excess powder from the applicator tip. Doing so helps, but we still noticed loose powder fallout during application\u2014and because each shade is so pigmented, trying to wipe the flaking off skin can result in a splotchy, muddy-looking mess.", "If you can manage to get this to go on without any fallout (difficult but not impossible), it's easy to stroke through brow hairs or glide along the lash line. Be prepared for a strong color deposit that is very difficult to soften, which you might want for eyeliner but probably not for eyebrows because on brows this level of color payoff can look quite intense, almost harsh. As it cannot be softened, at least not that much, you either live with it or remove it and start over.", "Back to the pluses, CoverGirl offers four very good, matte finish colors suitable for blonde to black brows. There are no shades suitable for red to auburn brows, which, sadly, is pretty typical for brow fillers. (This is likely due to the fact that it's challenging to sell through such shades at the same rate as others.)", "Used as eyeliner, the applicator only allows for a thicker line. If that's what you want or normally do, great; if not, you'll find using this product to line the eyes is limiting.  The formula doesn't make it easy to \"smoke out\" the line if you want to soften the look or go for a more dramatic yet diffused eyeliner effect.", "In the end, Bombshell Pow-Der Brow + Liner's combination of quirks and limited appeal leaves us with no choice but to rate it average among the various types of brow fillers and eyeliners.  A matte finish powder eyeshadow in a color that coordinates with brows (and, depending on your brow color, may also work as eyeliner) is much easier to use and also more versatile because you can better control the intensity.

We did not notice any flaking for the more metallic shades, however.", "The wear-time of these crayons was also all over the place. None of them traveled once set, but some of them creased pretty noticeably after just a few hours in an oddly splotchy manner. Our staffers with greasy eyelids found that using a well-formulated eyeshadow primer helped minimize creasing. Then again, others (such as \"Bronze Truffle\" and \"Audacious Asphalt\") were much longer lasting, showing minimal creasing on even the greasiest eyelids after a full workday, regardless of whether or not primer was used.

If you've read consumer reviews for 24/7 Waterline Eye Pencil, you've no doubt noticed that it seems to be a polarizing product\u2014while some attest to its brilliant power to adhere and maintain rich color in the waterline, others complain about its lack of resiliency.

This setup offers a range of versatility in creating a precisely thin or thick line based on what kind of brush you want to use. It's not a total slam dunk for those with very oily skin (we explain why below), but if you like the idea of customizable control from a liquid formula rather than being limited by a particular applicator's design, Got Inked Cushion Eye Liner is worth checking out!", "Got Inked Cushion Eye Liner glides across skin like a breeze, imparting rich color as it goes. As mentioned above, pairing it with the right brush for the type of line you want to create makes all the difference. Of course, Stila sells one to accompany it, featuring a narrow tip for precise strokes, but whether you go with Stila's brush or another, it's imperative to rinse the bristles after each use. Otherwise, the leftover product on the brush will harden as it dries.", "Speaking of drying, eventually over the course of using this product you'll find that the sponge doesn't seem as saturated with the product as it once did. When you dip your brush into it, the liquid won't adhere as richly and hence, you get a sheerer stroke of color. To rectify this, you can flip the sponge over and voila\u2014all the liquid that has been soaking at the bottom is now at the top.", "As far as the shades go, the range includes metallic hues of purple, blue, and brown, as well as matte shades of garnet and black.

It's the same packaging as the brand's other powder eyeshadows, and doesn't have \"Double Lining\" written anywhere on the compact or the box it comes in. So what's the difference between these shadows and Brown's other offerings? We checked with the brand, and they're the same formula as their standard eyeshadows\u2014the only exception is that the \"double lining\" shades are the darkest colors offered (such as deep brown, navy, and black) that are recommended for use when wet as eyeliner on Bobbi Brown's website.", "This isn't exactly a unique concept, as many powder eyeshadows can be used wet as liner to great effect! The \"double lining\" technique consists of first using the powder eyeshadow to line the lash line, then going over that with the brand's Long-Wear Gel Eyeliner. This is supposed to create extra dimension, though the effect is not much different than if you lined with the gel liner on its own. Double Lining Eyeshadow works well in this way, though, mainly because the gel liner applied over it acts as a sealant.", "When used on its own as a liner, this shadow has rich color and applies smoothly, and wears throughout a standard workday without smudging. It does, flake, however \u2014we noticed specks of this shadow on our cheeks about three hours into its wear time, making it less than ideal for just lining eyes on its own. In that sense, it becomes double duty because you have to use a product like Brown's gel eyeliner to keep this shadow from flaking.", "Used as a dry shadow, the formula performs well, with a texture that's soft but not overly powdery, and it's loaded with pigment.

If dramatically full, defined brows is what you want, this delivers, and it holds its own as powder eyeliner, too, with only slight fading throughout the day.", "The drawback is in how the concept (deeply pigmented loose powder) was executed. Bombshell Pow-Der Brow + Liner is housed in an inkwell-style component. Unscrewing the top reveals a pen-like applicator whose tip is a small, flexible spatula. The powder inside the base of the container adheres to the applicator, which is how you transfer it to brows and your lash line.", "Because this is loose powder, it can be messy, even if you're careful to knock off excess powder from the applicator tip. Doing so helps, but we still noticed loose powder fallout during application\u2014and because each shade is so pigmented, trying to wipe the flaking off skin can result in a splotchy, muddy-looking mess.", "If you can manage to get this to go on without any fallout (difficult but not impossible), it's easy to stroke through brow hairs or glide along the lash line. Be prepared for a strong color deposit that is very difficult to soften, which you might want for eyeliner but probably not for eyebrows because on brows this level of color payoff can look quite intense, almost harsh. As it cannot be softened, at least not that much, you either live with it or remove it and start over.", "Back to the pluses, CoverGirl offers four very good, matte finish colors suitable for blonde to black brows. There are no shades suitable for red to auburn brows, which, sadly, is pretty typical for brow fillers. (This is likely due to the fact that it's challenging to sell through such shades at the same rate as others.)", "Used as eyeliner, the applicator only allows for a thicker line. If that's what you want or normally do, great; if not, you'll find using this product to line the eyes is limiting.  The formula doesn't make it easy to \"smoke out\" the line if you want to soften the look or go for a more dramatic yet diffused eyeliner effect.", "In the end, Bombshell Pow-Der Brow + Liner's combination of quirks and limited appeal leaves us with no choice but to rate it average among the various types of brow fillers and eyeliners.  A matte finish powder eyeshadow in a color that coordinates with brows (and, depending on your brow color, may also work as eyeliner) is much easier to use and also more versatile because you can better control the intensity.

Keep reading to learn what we liked and where it fell short.", "This fragrance-free eyeshadow pencil is housed in a thick tube featuring a twist-up, self-sharpening design, which is both convenient and economical\u2014there is no need to purchase a separate sharpener (and no risk of waste due to manual sharpening). It's also free of any potential irritants, making it a good choice for those with sensitive eyes.", "Color Tattoo Concentrated Crayon is a multi-tasker because it can be used as both an eyeshadow and an eyeliner.

Unfortunately, this product's luck runs out there\u2026", "This creamy color sets very quickly, making blending near impossible. It's not all bad news, though, because that property helps it stay put. True to the \"tattoo\" portion of its name, this isn't a formula prone to smudging.", "We did find an inconsistency among shades when it came to two different aspects of wear, the first of which was flaking. The more glitter the shade contains, the greater propensity for some minor flaking. We did not notice any flaking for the more metallic shades, however.", "The wear-time of these crayons was also all over the place. None of them traveled once set, but some of them creased pretty noticeably after just a few hours in an oddly splotchy manner. Our staffers with greasy eyelids found that using a well-formulated eyeshadow primer helped minimize creasing. Then again, others (such as \"Bronze Truffle\" and \"Audacious Asphalt\") were much longer lasting, showing minimal creasing on even the greasiest eyelids after a full workday, regardless of whether or not primer was used. Whatever product is left at the end of the day removes easily with a standard makeup remover or cleanser.", "We were also disappointed in what we suspect many will find to be a limited range of shades. Maybelline played it safe by including several different shades of gold, gray, bronze, and purple, but didn't include any deeper browns, blues, or greens. We're hoping that as with the original Color Tattoos, Maybelline adds more shades in the future (and we'd love some matte options!)", "Overall, Maybelline's Color Tattoo Concentrated Crayon isn't a bad product by any stretch. At worst it's inconsistent in its wear-time and tendency to flake among shades. It also provides a convenient option for a combination eyeshadow/eyeliner pencil. Because it's affordable, it's one worth checking out as long as you adjust your expectations accordingly, but you'll find better options on our lists of best eyeshadows and best eyeliners."], "expert_pros": null, "expert_cons": null, "jar_package": null, "animal_test": null, "user_rating": null, "product_id": 591}

Where Pearlized falters slightly (compared to the other Super Shock Shadows), is that some of the shades (\"Plunge\", for example) have less color payoff on initial application. Across the board, the lighter shades appeared more sheer when applied, regardless of if an eyeshadow primer was used or not. The darker and visibly bold shades (such as \"Lace\") were much more pigmented. Because this shadow is easily blendable, buildable, and so affordable, however, we think it's worth checking out.

All shades lasted through a standard workday but some had more noticeable creasing than others. None flaked, but when we went to wash our face that night, we noticed some of the shades faded in really weird, almost \"splotchy\" patterns on our eyelids.

Various finishes are also in the mix, from satin to shimmer, with four mattes as well.", "Across the board, the initial issue with these shadows (and the reason they didn't earn a higher rating) is that their application is quite sheer to start. A single swipe of any of the 12 shades, no matter their color or texture, results in a light wash of color on lids. Even using a primer underneath, the initial application doesn't yield much color payoff. We like that the colors are buildable, but you have to take care when applying multiple layers of the shimmer shades, as some fallout can occur.", "Once applied, however, these shadows are standouts when it comes to performance. The fragrance-free formulas wore well throughout a standard workday without fading or flaking, and there was minimal creasing without primer. When we went to take off our makeup at the end of the day, the shadows appeared nearly as smooth as when we first put them on! Impressive? You bet!", "The shades are workable for a wide range of skin tones, and offer enough neutral options that everyday basic eye looks are simple to put together. The small number of brighter colors offer a nice accent to an eye look (as they're intended to do), and mean this is a palette than can easily transfer your look from day to night without the need for additional products.", "Overall, the NARS NARSissist L'Amour, Toujours L'Amour palette has a lot to offer.

The \"double lining\" technique consists of first using the powder eyeshadow to line the lash line, then going over that with the brand's Long-Wear Gel Eyeliner.

Lazarus and Liberatus are versatile and very blendable colors and have a smooth texture. Saleos is a bit more difficult to blend, as it applies patchy initially. It can be smoothed out with a soft shadow brush, but it requires extra time to do so. Shax, however, is surprisingly sheer for its color, making it appear splotchy instead of smooth, and it as well is difficult to blend evenly.", "The third quad includes the base shade \"Ludwin,\" which is a matte dusty peach; \"Succubus,\" a matte reddish rust-brown; \"Sytry,\" a rich matte cocoa brown; and \"Lucius,\" a creamy golden beige with soft shimmer. Ludwin and Lucius are both easy to blend and wear well, though Succubus, despite being a surprisingly workable color, goes on patchy at first, seemingly \"sitting\" where you apply it initially and taking extra effort to blend, and Sytry experiences fallout throughout the day.

Interestingly, this palette's most problem-prone shades share the same two formulas while the shades that perform better are slightly different formulas.", "All told, this is an ambitious palette featuring some gorgeous colors that work beautifully, but because there are shades in each quad that consistently have a splotchy application or fallout, this only earns an average, two-star rating.

There aren't very many of these other shades so not everyone will find a color they love; the bigger issue, however, is that they don't blend on that gracefully for a smooth eye design and can end up looking a little rough around the edges as a shadow. Some of the shades also go on much more sheer than you'd expect and they don't build color very well. As for the claims about this being waterproof: It's true that it does hold up well against water, but not against oily eyelids. If you're prone to creasing, you'll still likely experience that. In the brows it holds up better because your brow hairs help it stay in place.", "This doesn't come with an applicator/brush, but Armani of course sells one to accompany Eye & Brow Maestro, and although it works nicely (thin, slanted brush with a spoolie on the opposite end), you certainly can use a similar brush you already have at home or buy one for far less at the drugstore.", "Last, but not least: The fragrance-free formula doesn't blend on smoothly enough to contour your face, nor would you likely be able to find a shade that would look right for that.

Even using a primer underneath, the initial application doesn't yield much color payoff. We like that the colors are buildable, but you have to take care when applying multiple layers of the shimmer shades, as some fallout can occur.", "Once applied, however, these shadows are standouts when it comes to performance.

The initial application is quite sheer if you don't use a primer, and requires multiple layers to get visible color. Once the color does show up, it lasts for about seven hours without fading.", "The three palette options offered in the kit are very attractive; they include a set with plum and bronze shades, another with forest green, soft brown, and gold shades, and one with navy blue, gold, and chocolate brown tones.", "The color combinations are compelling, but each set offers at least two glitter/sparkle shades that flake and fall out as the day goes on. We found flecks of glitter under our eye and on our cheekbones by the end of its wear time, and even some fallout as we were applying them (this is an issue with the Modernist Palette as well). If you're going to rock a glitter eyeshadow, the least it should do is stay in place!", "Though Ulta's Artistry Eye Shadow Kit is pretty in the pan, its sheer application and the inclusion of several glitter-flecked shades that flake mean that even for its bargain price, it's far from the best option available.

The brow wax does an excellent job of keeping stray brow hairs in place without making them seem too waxy or stiff; instead, the result is soft and natural-looking brows. The brow powders come in two shades: \"Taupe\" (suitable for blonde eyebrows) and \"Soft Brown\" (suitable for medium to dark eyebrows). Both shades apply somewhat sheer initially but are buildable and enhance brows naturally without the color fading throughout the day.", "Four face powders are included: \"Highlight,\" \"Bronze,\" \"Contour,\" and \"Glow.\" Highlight is a creamy beige shade with slight shimmer that on lighter skin tones works as an all-over setting powder and on darker skin tones can buff out or soften some of the other shades. Bronze is a matte medium brown color that appears as a warm bronze on light to medium skin tones\u2014without appearing orange. Contour is a matte medium-taupe brown that serves very well as a contour, as it mimics the appearance of natural shadows that fall on the face (without appearing muddy). Glow is a light peachy shade with soft champagne shimmer that adds luminosity to the face without obvious glitter or sparkle. All the powders are buttery-smooth and easy to apply, and all wear well throughout an average work day without fading.", "The eyeshadows might be the true standouts of this palette, though. There are nine included, and they range from matte neutral shades to a couple of shimmery options (in purple-pink, gold, and platinum shades), and one very matte black. Their texture is incredibly smooth and easy to pick up with a brush, and they all blend remarkably well. The shimmer shades are attractive and do not flake, which is an added bonus.", "We should note there is a good dual-ended brush included in this palette (one side is angled for using with the brow wax and powders, the other is a soft blending brush for the shadows), though you will definitely need more than one brush to use this many colors!", "Overall, Smashbox's #Shapematters Palette is a standout thanks to the performance of its many products, and because considering the number of options included, it winds up being a beauty value.

Lazarus and Liberatus are versatile and very blendable colors and have a smooth texture. Saleos is a bit more difficult to blend, as it applies patchy initially. It can be smoothed out with a soft shadow brush, but it requires extra time to do so. Shax, however, is surprisingly sheer for its color, making it appear splotchy instead of smooth, and it as well is difficult to blend evenly.", "The third quad includes the base shade \"Ludwin,\" which is a matte dusty peach; \"Succubus,\" a matte reddish rust-brown; \"Sytry,\" a rich matte cocoa brown; and \"Lucius,\" a creamy golden beige with soft shimmer. Ludwin and Lucius are both easy to blend and wear well, though Succubus, despite being a surprisingly workable color, goes on patchy at first, seemingly \"sitting\" where you apply it initially and taking extra effort to blend, and Sytry experiences fallout throughout the day.

Interestingly, this palette's most problem-prone shades share the same two formulas while the shades that perform better are slightly different formulas.", "All told, this is an ambitious palette featuring some gorgeous colors that work beautifully, but because there are shades in each quad that consistently have a splotchy application or fallout, this only earns an average, two-star rating.
