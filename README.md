This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to run the Project

1. Make sure you have `node.js` environment and `npm/yarn` package manager.

2. Go to `./Frontend`, run `npm install` and `npm start` to start the front end. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

3. Go to `./Backend`, run `Python3 api.py` to start the back end.

4. If you want to run from scratch, go to `./Backend`, create a folder `data_raw`, then run 3 scrapers under `./Backend/IE/` 

## How to run the Deployed Project (Currently N/A)

4. Run `npm run build`, then in your terminal run `Python3 start.py` to start the front end and back end deployment APP at the same time.

5. You could also open http://13.57.28.139:5000/ to view the deployed web page. 
(Note: might need to inform me in advance to launch my server.)
